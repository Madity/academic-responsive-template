abstract = {One important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is searching and retrieving the correct information. However, existing searching mechanisms in pure peer-to-peer networks are inefficient due to the decentralized nature of such networks. We propose two mechanisms for information retrieval in pure peer-to-peer networks. The first, the modified Breadth-First-Search (BFS) mechanism, is an extension of the current Gnuttela protocol, allows searching with keywords, and is designed to minimize the number of messages that are needed to search the network. The second, the Intelligent Search mechanism, uses the past behavior of the P2P network to further improve the scalability of the search procedure. In this algorithm, each peer autonomously decides which of its peers are most likely to answer a given query. The algorithm is entirely distributed, and therefore scales well with the size of the network. We implemented our mechanisms as middleware platforms. To show the advantages of our mechanisms we present experimental results using the middleware implementation.},
