    <h3>Short Biography of Navjyoti Singh </h1>

    <p>Prof. Navjyoti Singh (1958-2018)
His life embodies an extraordinary philosophical quest of our times. His researches ranged from enquiries into foundations of science and mathematics to foundations of arts. At the same time, he was also a man of action. He was deeply involved in the organization of path-breaking Congresses of Traditional Sciences and Technology in different parts of the country and later on he founded and headed Centre for Exact Humanities at IIIT Hyderabad, which was conceived as a confluence of Humanities and Computer Science.
He made a deep study of Indian analytical traditions and evolved a new reading of Indian thought. His study of Ancient Greek thought led him to a new understanding of the idea of ‘form’. He was always in dialogue with various contemporary currents of thought. His quest for evolving a discretist view of reality was futuristic. Such a view, he thought, can provide an adequate account of human reality.
His philosophical interests had begun to flower during his student days at IIT Kanpur where he got his degrees in mechanical engineering and nuclear engineering. After finishing at IIT Kanpur, he joined NISTADS (National Institute of Science Technology and Development) at Delhi. He went on to co-ordinate a research project on ‘Foundations and Methodology of Theoretical Sciences in Indian Traditions’. This was followed by attempt to evolve a research network to conduct foundational inquiries into Indian thought under the rubric of ‘Prasthana Mimamsa’. Three conferences were organized as part of this effort in which eminent Indian philosophers participated. In the year 2000, he together with the eminent Indian philosopher Prof. P. K. Mukhopadhyay organized an International Summer School on ‘Working of Mind’ at Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla. Subsequently he developed a formal ontology based on the Vaisesika school and presented it at several workshops. There was a possibility of applying this to computer science. 
He established Centre for Exact Humanities at IIIT Hyderabad in 2008 where along with a PhD programme, a dual-degree undergraduate course was conceived which was first of its kind in the world. Students who joined this programme concurrently studied both humanities and computer science. His researches into foundations of arts were launched here and he worked closely with several artists as his research students. He organized and conducted two three-week workshops at Varanasi. First of these on Vaisesika Darshan also included a dialogue with traditional scholars. The second of these workshops on philosophy of Arts saw the participation and contribution from several film makers, musicians, poets in addition to other scholars. 
Towards the end, despite his illness, he continued teaching and guiding students in their research. He passed away on 3rd March 2018 having just completed 60 years. He was a bold insightful thinker deeply concerned with human predicament. He has left a rich legacy of work. He has opened up a vast terrain of rigorous thought on ontology, arts, society, justice and related issues for future generations to grapple with and develop further.
